If you are looking for a realistic and immersive simulation of the Boeing 737-200, you should definitely check out the MilViz Boeing 737-200 SP2 for FSX and P3D. It is a great addition to your virtual hangar and a joy to fly.
  
The MilViz Boeing 737-200 SP2 comes with two different cockpit configurations: the SP-177 with a Universal 1LW FMC, and the SP-77 with no FMS. The SP-177 is a more modern autopilot system that offers more features and modes than the SP-77, such as VNAV and LNAV. The Universal 1LW FMC is a realistic simulation of a flight management system that can be updated with Navigraph data. It allows you to enter your flight plan, performance data, and navigate using waypoints, airways, and procedures. The SP-77 is a simpler autopilot system that requires more manual input and navigation skills. It is suitable for those who prefer a more "old school" approach to flying the 737-200.
 
The MilViz Boeing 737-200 SP2 also includes a realistic startup and shutdown procedure that requires you to follow the checklist and operate the switches and knobs in the correct sequence. You will hear the authentic sounds of the Pratt & Whitney JT8D-17A engines spooling up and down, as well as other cockpit noises and warnings. The aircraft also features realistic systems and avionics that simulate the behavior and limitations of the real 737-200. For example, you will need to manage your fuel and electrical systems, monitor your engine instruments and fire protection system, and use the correct radio and navigation equipment for your flight.
 
The exterior model of the MilViz Boeing 737-200 SP2 is also very detailed and accurate, with high quality textures, normal and specular maps, custom lighting and effects, and various animations. The aircraft comes with several liveries that represent different operators of the 737-200, such as Air Florida, Alaska Airlines, Delta Airlines, Lufthansa, Pan Am, Ryanair, and more. You can also choose to enable or disable the gravel kit option for each livery, which adds a vortex dissipater system and a nose gear ski to protect the aircraft from debris when landing on unpaved runways.
